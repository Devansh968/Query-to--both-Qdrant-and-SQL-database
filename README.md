# Query-to--both-Qdrant-and-SQL-database
# Project: PDF Chat Solution & CSV/Excel to SQL Integration

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation details and documentation for two interconnected projects: the **PDF Chat Solution** and the **CSV/Excel to SQL Integration**. Both projects aim to enhance document interactivity and data querying using various technologies and integrations.

## PDF Chat Solution

The PDF Chat Solution is designed to enable interactive querying within PDF documents. It leverages several technologies for efficient document management and dynamic question-answering capabilities.

### Features

- Creation of an innovative PDF Chat solution for interactive querying within PDFs.
- Utilization of the Qdrant vector database and cloud storage for effective document embedding management.
- Integration of Langchain RetrievalQA to provide dynamic question-answering capabilities.
- Development of a user-friendly Streamlit web GUI for real-time PDF Chat visualization and navigation.
- Successful alignment of the solution with client use cases through presentations and demonstrations.

## CSV/Excel to SQL Integration

The CSV/Excel to SQL Integration project focuses on seamlessly integrating local CSV/Excel files into an SQLite database. Additionally, it incorporates OpenAI's language model for generating SQL queries based on user input, simplifying the querying process.

### Features

- Seamless integration of local CSV/Excel files into an SQLite database.
- Integration of OpenAI's language model to generate SQL queries from user input.
- Streamlining of querying and response generation from the database using auto-generated SQL queries.
- Unification of both projects within a single Streamlit interface, enhancing user experience and intuitiveness.
